## üìù Overview

In Week 4, we expanded our Java expertise by covering:

- **Generics:** Introduction, type parameters, generic classes and methods, bounded types, and wildcards.  
- **Collections Framework:** Overview, hierarchy, interfaces (List, Set, Queue, Deque, Map), implementations, comparisons, and best practices.  
- **Java IO Streams:** Types of streams, file, object, byte array, buffered streams, readers/writers, and best practices.  
- **Exception Handling:** Types of exceptions, try-catch-finally, try-with-resources, throws/throw statements, and creating custom exceptions.  
- **Regex & JUnit:** Regular expressions, common patterns (email, password, phone), Java Regex API, and unit testing with JUnit annotations and assertions.  
- **Java 8 Features:** Interface types, lambda expressions, Stream API, method references, and anonymous classes.
